# Willset Melee
Welcome to Willset Melee! If you're reading this, these are probably the rules you'll be using for Freeciv.

## Description
Willset Melee is a combat-focused variant of the Willset rules. If you aren't familiar with the Willset rules, the basic gist is that they're like the normal rules, but with a few tweaks -- perhaps most importantly, that cities grow more quickly, and maps are larger.

## Issues
There are probably a bunch of problems with this ruleset, especially with unit comments and descriptions. I typically work on this quickly before games.

Let me (Willmo3) know or slap in a pull request!
